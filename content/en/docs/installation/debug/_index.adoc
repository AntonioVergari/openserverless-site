= Debug

This document gives you hints for diagnostics and solving issues, using the (hidden) subcommand `debug`.

Note it is technical and assumes you have some knowledge of how Kubernetes operates.

== Watching

While installing, you can watch the installation (opening another terminal) with the command:

----
nuv debug watch
----

Check that no pods will go in error while deploying.


== Configuration

You can inspect the configuration with the `nuv debug subcommand`

* API host: `nuv debug apihost`
* Static Configuration: `nuv debug config`. 
* Current Status : `nuv debug status`
* Runtimes: `nuv debug runtimes`
* Load Balancer: `nuv debug lb`
* Images: `nuv debug images`

== Logs

You can inspect logs with `nuv debug log` subcommand. Logs you can show:

* operator: `nuv debug log operator` (continuously: `nuv debug log foperator`)
* controller: `nuv debug log controller` (continuously: `nuv debug log fcontroller`)
* database: `nuv debug log couchdb` (continuously: `nuv debug log fcouchdb`)
* certificate manager: database: `nuv debug log certman` (continuously: `nuv debug log fcertmap`)

== Kubernetes

You can detect which Kubernetes are you using with:

`nuv debug detect`

You can then inspect Kubernetes objects with:

* namespaces: `nuv debug kube ns`
* nodes: `nuv debug kube nodes`
* pod: `nuv debug kube pod`
* services: `nuv debug kube svc`
* users: `nuv debug kube users`


You can enter a pod by name (use `kube pod` to find the name) with:

----
nuv debug kube exec P=<pod-name>
----

== Kubeconfig

Usually, `nuv` uses a hidden kubeconfig so does not override your Kubernetes configuration.

If you want to go more in-depth and you are knowledgeable of Kubernetes, 
you can export the kubeconfig with `nuv debug export F=<file>`.

You can *overwrite your kubeconfig* (be aware there is no backup) with `nuv debug export F=-`.
