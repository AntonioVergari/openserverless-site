== Prerequisites to install Nuvolaris in an Azure AKS Cluster

https://aws.amazon.com/eks/[Azure AKS] is a pre-built Kubernetes cluster offered by the cloud provider https://azure.microsoft.com/[Microsoft Azure].

You can create an AKS Cluster in Microsoft Azure for installing using Nuvolaris using xref:download.adoc[nuv] as follows:

. install `az`, the <<install-cli, Azure CLI>>
. <<configure, configure AKS>>
. <<provision, provision AKS>>
. optionally, retrieve the <<retrieve-lb, load balancer address>> to configure a DNS name

Once you have AKS up and running you can proceed xref:configure.adoc[configuring] and xref:install-cluster.adoc[installing Nuvolaris].

[#install-cli]
== Installing the Azure CLI

Our CLI `nuv` uses under the hood the https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/[Azure CLI], so you need to dowload and install it https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli[following those instructions].

Once installed, ensure it is available on the terminal executing the following command:

----
az version
----

you should receive something like this:


----
{
  "azure-cli": "2.51.0",
  "azure-cli-core": "2.51.0",
  "azure-cli-telemetry": "1.1.0",
  "extensions": {}
}
----


[#configure]
== Configuring Azure AKS

Before provisioning your AKS cluster you need to configure AKS with the command `nuv config aks` answering to all the questions, as in the following example:

----
$ nuv config aks
*** Please, specify AKS Name for Cluster and Resource Group and press enter.
Just press enter for default [nuvolaris]: 

*** Please, specify AKS number of worker nodes and press enter.
Just press enter for default [3]: 

*** Please, specify AKS location and press enter.
To get a list of valid values use:
  az account list-locations -o table

Just press enter for default [eastus]: 

*** Please, specify AKS virtual machine type and press enter.
To get a list of valid values use:
  az vm list-sizes --location <location> -o table
where <location> is your current location.

Just press enter for default [Standard_B4ms]: 

*** Please, specify AKS disk size in gigabyte and press enter.
Just press enter for default [50]: 

*** Please, specify AKS public SSH key in AWS and press enter.
If you already have a public SSH key provide its path here. If you do not have it, generate a key pair with the following command:
  ssh-keygen
The public key defaults to ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.

Just press enter for default [~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub]: 
----

[#provision]
== Provisioning Azure AKS

Once you have configured it, you can create the AKS cluster with the command:

----
nuv cloud aks create
----

It will take around 10 minutes to be ready. Please be patient.

At the end of the process, you will have access directly to the created Kubernetes cluster for installation.

[#retrieve-lb]
== Retrieving the Load Balancer DNS name

Once the cluster is up and running, you need to retrieve the DNS name of the load balancer.

You can read this with the command:

----
nuv cloud aks lb
----

Take note of the result as it is required for  xref:configure-dns.adoc[configuring a dns name] for your cluster.

== Additional Commands

You can delete the created cluster with: `nuv cloud aks delete`

You can extract again the cluster configuration, if you lose it, reconfiguring the cluster and then using the command `nuv cloud aks kubeconfig`.
