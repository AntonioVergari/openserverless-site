== Prerequisites to install Nuvolaris in a Google GKE Cluster

https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine[Google GKE] is a pre-built Kubernetes cluster offered by the cloud provider https://cloud.google.com/gcp[Google Cloud Platform (GCP)].

You can create a GKE Cluster in GCP for installing using Nuvolaris using xref:download.adoc[nuv] as follows:

. install the <<install-cli, GCloud CLI>>
. <<configure, configure GKE>>
. <<provision, provision GKE>>
. optionally, retrieve the <<retrieve-lb, load balancer address>> to configure a DNS name

Once you have GKE up and running you can proceed xref:configure.adoc[configuring] and xref:install-cluster.adoc[installing Nuvolaris].

[#install-cli]
== Installing the GCloud CLI

Our cli `nuv` uses under the hood the https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud[GCloud CLI version 2], so you need to dowload and install it https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install[following those instructions].

Once installed, ensure it is available on the terminal executing the following command:

----
gcloud version
----

you should receive something like this:

====
`
Google Cloud SDK 443.0.0
beta 2023.08.11
bq 2.0.96
bundled-python3-unix 3.9.16
core 2023.08.11
gcloud-crc32c 1.0.0
gke-gcloud-auth-plugin 0.5.5
gsutil 5.25
`
====

[#configure]
== Configuring GKE

Before starting, you need to create a project in Google Cloud. Then, to install GKE you need to configure `nuv` for GKE with the command `nuv config gke` answering to all the questions, as in the following example:

----
$ nuv config gke
*** Please, specify GCloud Project Id and press enter.
nuvolaris
*** Please, specify GCloud Cluster Name and press enter.
The cluster name must be unique.

Just press enter for default [nuvolaris]: 

*** Please, specify GCloud Cluster Zone and press enter.
To get a list of valid values use:
  gcloud compute zones list

Just press enter for default [us-east1]: 

*** Please, specify GCloud number of worker nodes and press enter.
Just press enter for default [3]: 

*** Please, specify GKE virtual machine type and press enter.
To get a list of valid values, use:
  gcloud compute machine-types list

Just press enter for default [e2-standard-2]: 

*** Please, specify GKE disk size in gigabyte and press enter.
Just press enter for default [50]: 
----

Once you have configured it, you can create the EKS cluster with the command:

----
nuv cloud gke create
----

It will take around 10 minutes to be ready. Please be patient.

At the end of the process, you will have access directly to the created Kubernetes cluster for installation.

[#retrieve-lb]
== Retrieving the Load Balancer DNS name

Once the cluster is up and running, you need to retrieve the DNS name of the load balancer.

You can read this with the command:

----
nuv cloud gke lb
----

Take note of the result as it is required for  xref:configure-dns.adoc[configuring a dns name] for your cluster.

== Additional Commands

You can delete the created cluster with: `nuv cloud gke delete`

You can extract again the cluster configuration, if you lose it, reconfiguring the cluster and then using the command `nuv cloud gke kubeconfig`.
