= Prerequisites to install Nuvolaris with Docker

You can install Nuvolaris on your local machine using Docker. This page lists the prerequisits.

First and before all you need a computer with at least 16 GB of memory and 30GB of available space.

[IMPORTANT]
====
8GB are definitely **not enough** to run Nuvolaris on your local machine.
====

Furthermore, you need to install Docker. Let's see the which one to install and configure if you ave:

* <<windows, Windows>>
* <<macos, MacOS>>
* <<linux, Linux>>

[#windows]
== Installing Docker on Windows

You require the 64 bit edition in Intel Architecture of a recent version of Windows (at least version 10). The installer `nuv` does not run on 32 bit versions nor in the ARM architecture.

Download and install https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/[Docker Desktop] for Windows.

Once installed, you can proceed xref:configure.adoc[configuring Nuvolaris] for the installation.

[#macos]
== Installing Docker on MacOS

You require a recent version of MacOS (at least version 11.xb BigSur). The installer `nuv` is available both for Intel and ARM. 

Download and install https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/[Docker Desktop] for MacOS.

Since MacOS uses a virtual machine for Docker with a constrained memory. you also need also to reserve at least 8GB.

[IMPORTANT]
====
On MacOS, the default 2GB and they are definitely **not enough** to run Nuvolaris on your local machine.
====

Instructions to increase the memory reserved to Docker Desktopo on MacOS:

* click on the Docker Desktop icon in the menu
* select Preferences
* click on Resources
* _increase the reserved memory up to (at least) 8GB_
* click on `Apply & Restart`

Once installed, you can proceed xref:configure.adoc[configuring Nuvolaris] for the installation.

[#linux]
== Installing Docker on Linux

Docker Desktop is available also on Linux, however we advice to install instead the https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/#server[Server Docker Engine] 

On Linux, the Docker Engine for the server does not run in a virtual machine, so it is faster and uses less memory. 

Once installed, you can proceed xref:configure.adoc[configuring Nuvolaris] for the installation.
