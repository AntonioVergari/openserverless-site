== Installation Overview

If you are in hurry and you think this guide is TL;DR (too long, don't read), please read at least our xref:quickstart/index.adoc[Quick Start] single page installation guide. 

It gives you an overview of the installation process,  omitting some more advanced details. It  can be enough to get you started and install OpenServerless.

Once you want to know more, you can come back.

If you instead want the read the full documentation first, please read on.

== Installation Steps

OpenServerless can be installed in many environments, using our powerful command line interface `ops`. 

So you should start downloading the CLI xref:download/index.adoc[from this page].

Once you installed `ops`, before installing you need to xref:prereq/index.adoc[check the prerequisites] for the installation, and satisfy them

If the the prerequisites are OK, you can make your choices of what you want to xref:configure/index.adoc[Configure] your OpenServerless installation. 

Finally, once you have:

. downloaded `ops`
. satisfied the prerequisites  
. configured your installation

you can choose where to install, either:

* in your xref:install/local/index.adoc[Local machine]
* in a xref:install/server/index.adoc[Linux server]
* in a xref:install/cluster/index.adoc[Kubernetes cluster]

== Post Installation

After the installation, you can change later the configuration and update the system.

== Support
